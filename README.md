# svelte-maplibre

Svelte wrapper for the [maplibre](https://maplibre.org/projects/maplibre-gl-js/) mapping library.

This library is functional, but I'm still experimenting with extra features to make advanced functionality easier to use. It also needs proper documentation. In the meantime, the [demo site](https://svelte-maplibre.vercel.app) includes code for all the examples, and is a good place to start.
